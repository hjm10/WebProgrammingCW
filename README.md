*2D Multiplayer Game (monster game)*

**Members and Tasks:**
- Hannah McCarvill: repository

**Game Idea/Rules:**
- There are 5 players that start running at the beginning of the game 
- After 10(?) seconds of running, the monster is released and starts chasing the players across the screen
- The players must navigate randomly generated obstacles that change each time
- To win the game, the players must reach the end of the map to win or be caught by the monster
- Have the option of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard 
- The harder the difficulty, the faster the monster and the more obstacles there are

**Obstacles:**
- Crumbling blocks that give way to obstacle like spikes or fire
- Spikes on track 
- Pieces of track that rise up so have to jump over them or wall that forces you to go another way
- Rolling logs

**Rewards:**
- Tether that allows you to pull the player ahead of you behind you
- Perks - life, speed, shield
- Smoke bomb to put behind you and damage playersâ€™ progress / bomb that can kill a certain number of players behind you to put you more in the lead in the game.

- Mud (run through to make you slower) 
- Water (makes you slip)
- Rake in face (makes you dizzy for a few seconds, like in Tom and Jerry episodes)

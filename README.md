*2D Multiplayer Game (monster game)*

**Game Idea/Rules:**

- The player starts running at the beginning of the game.
- The player has to avoid the pillars by passing through the gaps in between them.
- After 10 seconds of running, the monster is released and starts chasing the player across the screen.
- The player must navigate throught the pillars whilst being chased by the monster, if they are hit by the pillar the monster will start to catch up to them.
- To win the game, the players must reach the end of the course and not get killed by the monster.
- Enjoy the game

**Slow Down**
- The player will slow down if they hit a pillar as they will have to move around it and this will give the monster time to catch up with the player

Monster game

Idea/Rules: There are 5 players that start running at the beginning of the game 
	         After 10? Seconds of running the monster is released and starts chasing the players across the screen
	         The players must navigate randomly generated obstacles that change each time
	         To win the game the players must reach the end of the map to win or be caught by the monster
	         Have the option of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard 
	         Harder the difficulty the faster the monster and the more obstacles there are

      <h1>Welcome to out Monster Game</h1>
      <p>This is a game about running away from a monster whilst avoiding hitting the pillars in front of you by passing through the gaps in between them. We hope you enjoy the game.</p>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <p>1. Use the arrow keys to move around the screen</p>
      <p>2. You get a 10 secind head start on the monster chasing after you, make it count!</p>
      <p>3. Avoid the pillars in front of you to prevent the monster from catching up to you by passing through the gaps in the pillars.</p>
      <p>4. If you hit the pillar the monster will start to catch up to you.</p>
      <p>5. If the monster catches up to you the game will be over.</p>

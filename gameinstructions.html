    <h1>Welcome to our Monster Game</h1>
    <p>This is a game about running away from a monster whilst avoiding hitting the pillars in front of you by passing
        through the gaps in between them. We hope you enjoy the game.</p>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <p>1. Use the arrow keys to move around the screen</p>
    <p>2. You get a 10 second head start on the monster chasing after you, make it count!</p>
    <p>3. Avoid the pillars in front of you to prevent the monster from catching up with you by passing through the gaps
        in the pillars.</p>
    <p>4. If you hit the pillar the monster will start to catch up with you.</p>
    <p>5. If the monster catches up with you the game will be over.</p>
    <p>6. You can play the game again if you do not win against the monster on your first try.</p>
    <p>ENJOY!!</p>
